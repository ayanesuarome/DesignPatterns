High level modules should not depend on low level module. Both should depend on abstractions.

Violation
Product ---> SqlProductRepository

SqlProductRepository should implement an interface IProductRepository
Product should not depend on object of type SqlProductRepository. Instead it should
has an instance of IProductRepository that calls the initializaton either using Dependency Injection Pattern or Factory Pattern.

Correction
Product ---> IProductRepository <--- SqlProductRepository


Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

Dependency Injection
IoC (Inversion of Control) Autofac, Spring Container
